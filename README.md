# Pose Detection using OpenCV

## A fully functional example project showing how to perform pose detection in a video stream.

The project is an example built along with a youtube series demonstrating how to perform pose estimation in python using opencv and MoveNet model. Following are some applications of this example:
* Gait Analysis
* Movement Analysis
* Augmented Reality
* Action Recognition

## Body Landmarks
The model detects 16 different landmarks on the body as shown in the image below.
